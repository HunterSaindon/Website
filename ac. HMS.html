            Malware spreads in numerous ways, exploiting both technical vulnerabilities and human error. One of the most common methods is phishing, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from trusted sources. These emails often contain harmful links or attachments that, once clicked, download malware onto the user's device. Phishing attacks are frequently personalized, using social engineering techniques to deceive users into believing the email is genuine.

            Another common method is through malicious websites. Sometimes, merely visiting an infected site can lead to a malware download, without any user action, in what is known as a drive-by download. Attackers often compromise legitimate websites, embedding malicious code that infects unsuspecting visitors. Users might also encounter pop-up ads that falsely claim their system is infected with a virus, luring them into downloading fake "antivirus" software, which is actually malware.

            Removable media such as USB drives can also spread malware from one system to another. If a user inserts an infected USB into their computer, the malware can automatically execute, compromising the device. Public USB charging stations, often found in airports or cafes, can sometimes be a source of malware infections, with attackers inserting malicious files into the charging system.

            Another method, less reliant on human interaction, involves worms. These self-replicating malware variants can spread across networks without any direct action by the user. A worm enters one device, then quickly spreads through the connected network, infecting other systems and causing widespread damage. These kinds of attacks can cripple entire businesses or organizations, disrupting their operations by taking down multiple systems simultaneously.

            Attackers can also take advantage of outdated software or operating systems. When software is not kept up-to-date, it becomes vulnerable to exploitation. Cybercriminals search for these security gaps, using them as entry points for malware. Zero-day exploits —attacks that occur the same day a vulnerability is discovered—are particularly dangerous since they target systems before patches are available.

            Lastly, the rise of malicious apps has become a growing concern, especially on mobile devices. Many users unknowingly download malware disguised as legitimate apps, often from untrusted sources or unofficial app stores. These apps can steal sensitive data, track user activity, or even take control of the device. Mobile malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and with the growing reliance on smartphones for personal and business activities, the potential for damage is greater than ever.
