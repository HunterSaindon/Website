        <p>
            Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any kind of software intentionally created to cause harm to a computer, network, or device. Its primary purpose is to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems, often without the knowledge or consent of the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malware is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of harmful programs, each designed to perform different malicious tasks. These programs range from those that can cause minor inconveniences to extremely dangerous ones capable of significant financial and data loss, or even compromising personal privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most well-known types of malware is the virus, which attaches itself to clean files and spreads throughout the system, corrupting files and potentially rendering your device unusable. Worms are another common type; they replicate themselves and spread independently from one device to another, usually within a network, without needing a host file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trojans are malware disguised as legitimate software. They trick users into installing them, opening a backdoor to the system, which attackers can then exploit to steal sensitive information or gain control of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ransomware is a particularly dangerous form of malware that locks users out of their devices or encrypts their files, demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring access. Often, victims are pressured into paying quickly due to fear of losing their data permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spyware operates stealthily in the background, gathering information about your online activities, such as passwords, browsing habits, or personal data, which can then be used for identity theft or sold on the dark web.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another common type is adware, which bombards users with unwanted advertisements, often slowing down the deviceâ€™s performance or creating an annoying and disruptive user experience. While not always harmful, adware can sometimes pave the way for more dangerous malware to enter the system.
