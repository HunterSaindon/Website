            <h3>Introduction to Malware</h3>
            <p>
                Malware, short for malicious software, refers to programs or code designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system. Cybercriminals use malware to exploit vulnerabilities in computers, mobile devices, or networks.

            <h3>How Does Malware Work?</h3>
            <p>
                Malware can infect your devices in several ways. Once installed, it can manipulate data, record keystrokes, redirect browsers, or even lock you out of your system. Common infection methods include phishing emails, fake software downloads, and compromised websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many types of malware work quietly in the background, gathering personal information such as login credentials, banking details, and browsing habits, while others are more aggressive, locking files or disabling essential functions.

            <h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
            <p>
                Malware doesn’t just affect companies or tech-savvy individuals; everyone is at risk. Whether it’s a virus slowing down your computer or ransomware holding your files hostage, malware can cause significant financial loss, privacy breaches, and stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                By understanding how malware spreads and recognizing the signs of infection, you can take action to secure your devices and personal data. It’s important to be proactive about cybersecurity to avoid becoming a victim.
